<p>The two main VisIt elements are the databases and the plots. The databases are the files that
contain the data that we aim to visualize with VisIt. The plots are the visualizations we create with
the data. In this section, we introduce and provide examples of different databases and plots, as well
as other relevant aspects of VisIt, that we will later use for our numerical relativity visualizations.</p>
<h2 id="databases">Databases</h2>
<p>Databases are files or collections of files that are loaded into VisIt for visualization. In numerical
relativity, databases usually contain 3D spatial data at multiple time steps. However, VisIt also
supports 1D and 2D databases. VisIt has an extensive list of file formats that it supports. When
these file are loaded—provided that they are generated and formatted properly—VisIt automatically
detects the type of data that the database contains (e.g. scalar or vector, 2D or 3D). In this section,
we will describe a few file types that are commonly used in numerical relativity.</p>
<h3 id="hdf5-data">HDF5 Data</h3>
<p>HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format) data [8] is a file format that allows developers to store and
manipulate large amounts of data. In numerical relativity, outputting the variables we are interested
in visualizing often requires terabytes of data, which is why we use the HDF5 file format for the
simulation output. Additionally, HDF5 has multi-threading support, which allows us to leverage
parallel processing to speed up the scientific visualization process.
HDF5 organizes data in two ways: groups and datasets. Groups can be thought of as links
between data objects, such as a directory file structure that connects folders together. Datasets are
packages of raw data that the file contains with additional information describing the data itself.
The HDF5 data that the Illinois GRMHD code [4] outputs for visualization, stores datasets.
Since outputting HDF5 data is done by the evolution code, we will not discuss how to generate
HDF5 files. However, we will go over how to view the contents and structure of HDF5 files. We
provide a sample HDF5 file that can be found at VisIt-Guide/sec_4/Bx.file_0.h5. This file is
just 1 out of 128 separate files that together contain data for the x component of the magnetic field
at a couple of times.
While working with HDF5 data, there are two command line tools that are especially useful to
know, h5ls and h5dump, which can be used to view the h5 data. The command h5dump displays the
content of the HDF5 file. When executed with no options, this command displays (dumps) all of
the raw data in the terminal. Several useful options that can allow the user to extract information
from an HDF5 file more effectively are listed below.</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Viewing file contents:</strong> With the -n or -contents flag after the h5dump command (Fig. 12),
        we can list all of the data stored in the h5 file, which can be especially useful when trying to
        pick up minute pieces of information quickly from the file. Additionally, we are able to view
        the headers or titles of the data with corresponding information through the -H or -header
        flag after the h5dump command (Fig. 13), which can be used to extract specific details about
        the datasets themselves, such as their attributes and data types.
    </li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="alt text" src="../img/figures/Visitguide_h5dump1.png" /></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p>Figure 12: h5dump with contents flag (h5dmp -n)</p>
</div>

<div style="padding-left: 2em; line-height: 1.5;">
   Similarly, the h5ls command can be used to display data stored within the groups and datasets
   recursively. The output of h5ls is often more streamlined than the output of h5dump. When
   the -v flag is used with the h5ls command, the different properties of the dataset such as the
   storage capacity, file contents, and attributes are shown, providing a more detailed snapshot
   of the HDF5 file.
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p>Figure 13: h5dump with header flag (h5dump -H)</p>
</div>

<ol start="2">
    <li>
        <strong>Viewing datasets/groups:</strong> If we want to view the datasets or groups in an HDF5 file, we can use the -d "Dataset Name" or -g "Group Name" flag with the h5dump command. These flags allow us to analyze specific components of the data that we are interested as well as the raw data stored within the dataset.
</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="alt text" src="../img/figures/guideh5dump-d.png" /></p>
<div style="padding-left: 2em; line-height: 1.5;">
      Some additional flags that might prove useful in combination with the h5dump command CLI
      tool might be the -A 0 flag, which suppresses attributes when displaying data from the h5 file
      and simplifies the output quite a bit. We could also index specific datasets or groups that
      have specific additions through the -N PATH flag, which matches any object within the h5 file
      the another object or attribute at a specific path. 
</div>

<div style="padding-left: 2em; line-height: 1.5;">
   Within the h5ls CLI tool, we can index specific datasets by simply adding the path of the
   dataset within the h5 file. The -d or -data flag can be used in combination with the h5ls
   command in order to display the corresponding data within the specific dataset of the h5 file.
</div>

<h3 id="vtk-files">VTK Files</h3>
<p>Another important data type used in these simulations are Visualization ToolKit (VTK) files. VTK
files are ASCII or binary files that can easily be generated using Python scripts or similar methods.
The VTK file format is versatile and allows users to convert a database to be plotted in VisIt. VTK
files can store scalar, vector, or tensor data on 2D or 3D grids. We break the VTK file format down
into six sections.</p>
<ol>
   <li><u>Header:</u>The header is the first line of a VTK file and contains the file version and identifier.
The header is written as # vtk DataFile Version x.x where the x.x is the version number.</li> 
   <li><u>Title:</u>The title is a string limited to 256 characters. The title is not used by VisIt but should
be a description of the data contained in the VTK file.</li> 
   <li><u>Data Type:</u>The data type can either be BINARY or ASCII. Reading and writing binary data is
quicker. However, binary data is only portable across different machines if the machines have
the same byte ordering. If the byte ordering between machines differed, then binary VTK
files need to be preprocessed before they are able to be read by VisIt. Because we don’t work
with large datasets when using VTK files, we use ASCII data because of its flexibility and
simplicity.</li> 
   <li><u>Grid Structure:</u>This section begins with a line containing DATASET followed by a keyword that
describes the structure of the grid. The options are STRUCTURED_POINTS, STRUCTURED_GRID,
UNSTRUCTURED_GRID, POLYDATA, STRUCTURED_POINTS, RECTILINEAR_GRID, or FIELD. Depend-
ing on which option is used, there are additional lines that are required to specify the grid
(e.g. the dimensions and spacing). Detailed information can be found in the VTK file format
documentation:

<a href="https://examples.vtk.org/site/VTKFileFormats/"><code>https://examples.vtk.org/site/VTKFileFormats/</code></a>
</li> 
   <li><u>Data Set Attributes:</u>This section begins with either POINT_DATA or CELL_DATA followed by an
integer specifying the number of points or cells of the data. The next line specifies the type of
data using one of the keywords SCALARS, VECTORS, or TENSORS. Following this keyword are
the dataName and dataType. The dataName is a short string-identifier and is the variable
that shows up in VisIt when a VTK file is loaded as a database. The dataType—which differs
from the earlier ASCII vs binary data type—describes the type of numerical data (e.g. int,
float, double).</li> 
   <li><u>Data:</u>Following the first five sections, data is output. The structure of the data will depend
on the grid chosen in step 4 as well as the type of data (scalar, vector, tensor).</li> 
</ol>

<p>In Code Lst. 4.1.2, we show an example of a truncated VTK data file that contains vector field
data.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Code Lst. 4.1.2:<code>Example of a VTK file</code></p>
<p>Here, the header is # vtk DataFile Version 2.0, the title is spin_vector, and the data type
is ASCII. The grid structure is DATASET STRUCTURED_POINTS, which is a 1D, 2D, or 3D grid with
evenly spaced grid points. To fully specify the grid structure of STRUCTURED_POINTS, we must add the
lines DIMENSIONS, ORIGIN, and SPACING. By setting DIMENSIONS to 3 3 3, we choose a 3×3×3 grid
(which also implicitly chooses 3D). By setting ORIGIN to -30 -30 -30 and SPACING to 30 30 30,
we set the grid to be [−30, 30] × [−30, 30] × [−30, 30] where the coordinates can take the values
x, y, z ∈ {−30, 0, 30}. The ORIGIN specifies the corner of the grid closest to the −x, −y, −z quadrant
and the SPACING specifies the distance between grid points. In the data set attributes section, we
have the lines POINT_DATA 27 and VECTORS spinvec float. The first line communicates that we
are specifying data on the grid points and that we have a total of 33 = 27 grid points. The second line
specifies that our data is vector data (i.e. we need to specify a vector at each point on the grid). We
set the dataName to spinvec and the dataType to float. After this section is the actual data, which
is truncated but should contain 27 lines of 3 floats separated by spaces. With STRUCTURED_POINTS,
the data is ordered with x increasing fastest, then y, then z. So the first four lines of data would
correspond to the points (−30, −30, −30), (−30, −30, 0), (−30, −30, 30), (−30, 0, −30).</p>
<h2 id="plots-and-operators">Plots and Operators</h2>
<p>Once databases are loaded into VisIt, plots are created using the data to produce a visualization.
Operators can be applied to the plots to modify the resulting information. Plots and operators both
have settings that change different aspects of the visualization ranging from aesthetics to compute
time and numerical accuracy. It is important to understand how different plots and operators are used and how their settings affect the resulting visualization.</p>
<h3 id="volume-rendering">Volume Rendering</h3>
<p>Volume rendering, which is employed by the Volume plot, is a way of visualizing 3D scalar fields such
as the fluid density. With volume rendering, different values in the scalar field are mapped to different
colors and opacities. This mapping allows certain values to be emphasized. Additionally, because
the mapping is continuous, volume rendering can create high-quality plots that can incorporate all
the input data in the final rendered image with proper configuration. Since GRMHD simulations
involve a fluid density (which is a scalar field) that is used to model neutron stars and accretion
disks, volume rendering is an important tool for visualization in numerical relativity.
Volume rendering within VisIt can be broken into three distinct methods: Splatting, 3D
Texturing, and Ray Casting, however Ray Casting is essentially the only method that is used within
scientific visualizations due to its precision. For both Splatting and 3D Texturing, the volume
rendering methods are hardware accelerated, which means that they leverage the graphics card to
produce the image. Unfortunately, this means that the dataset must fit onto the graphics card,
so, as the dataset becomes larger, the data will have to be resampled and fed into the graphics
card, resulting in a loss of quality within the images. On the other hand, Ray Casting is a more
computationally intensive volume rendering technique and uses the entire dataset; however, the
computational load can be parallelized to produce high quality images in a timely manner.
Ray casting volume rendering works in three steps. First, the scalar database must be loaded
into VisIt. From here, we specify a camera/viewing angle (think a camera positioned at a point
in 3D space pointed at the data). From this camera angle, rays are shot out from each pixel of
the camera and intersect with the volume data’s cells. After the rays interact with the data, VisIt
assigns a color and opacity to each pixel based on the “transfer function”, which is the configuration
settings set by the user that controls exactly how VisIt decides the pixel’s colors and opacity.
An example of ray casting volume rendering used to visualize a magnetized accretion disk that
surrounds a binary black hole system can be seen in Fig. 14. For the remainder of the guide, we
will refer to ray casting volume rendering as simply volume rendering.
For our visualizations, we find that the following Volume plot settings are the most important.</p>
<ol>
   <li><u><code>colorControlPointList</code>: colorbar used for plot</u>
The colorbar is created through a series of color points placed at different relative density
values. The colorControlPoint field takes in the RGBA color value and the density data
distribution percentage. Unlike isosurface rendering, rendering automatically fills in the
missing color values. Thus, we don’t need to create an elaborate color table with too many
intermediate colors.
</li>
</ol>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p>Figure 14: Ray casting volume rendering of a magnetized accretion disk around a binary black hole
system</p>
</div>

<ol start="2">
</li> 
   <li><u><code>freeformOpacity</code>: Opacity map used for plot</u>
   Instead of filling up the colorbar with different color palettes, we are able to exercise fine
control over what density values are displayed through the 256-bit freeform array.The colorbar is projected over this array with each value corresponding to a unique density distribution
percentage. A 0 corresponds to complete transparency whereas 256 corresponds to complete
opacity. In terms of array positioning, the first index corresponds to the lowest density
value (this is the outermost layer of the disk/neutron star). Similarly, the last index position
corresponds to the highest density value. By assigning different opacity values to different
array positions we are able to “activate” different parts of the volume plot (for example we
can emphasize the higher densities in an accretion disk by increasing the opacity of the higher
density values relative to lower densities).
</li>
   <li><u><code>opacityAttenuation</code>: Adjusts overall transparency</u>
While the freeform array helps control the finer transparency details, we can also increase
or decrease the overall transparency of the volume plot. This is often done at the end after
constructing the colorbar and opacity array (for example we decrease the opacityAttenuation
when we want to be able to see a black hole that is obstructed by the accretion disk).
</li> 
    <li><u><code>colorVarMin/Max:</code>: Changes limits on colorbar</u>
If we want to only visualize a certain range of the data, we can explicitly specify the minimum
and maximum density values after setting useColorVarMin/Max to true. In volume plots of the
density, we actually plot the logarithm of a normalized rest-mass density log(ρ0 /ρmax
). Because
0
of this, we always set colorVarMax to 0. For the accretion disk, we set colorVarMin to −4.
This range of (−4, 0) is reflected by the colorbar in Fig. 17. Note that changes in min and max
values should be followed up with corresponding changes in the opacityAttenuation array since opacityAttenuation assigns opacity relative to the range specified by colorVarMax/Min.
For instance, if the first half of opacityAttenuation is filled with zeros, then the densities
with log(ρ0 /ρmax
) ∈ (−4, −2) will be transparent. If we increase colorVarMin to −2 while
0
keeping opacityAttenuation the same, then the densities with log(ρ0 /ρmax
) ∈ (−2, −1)
0
will be transparent. Note that values outside the range (colorVarMin,colorVarMax) are
transparent.

</li> 
   <li><code>samplesPerRay:</code>: Adjusts smoothness and resolution of plot</code> 
As mentioned before, ray casting creates the plot by shooting rays and sampling the points
in its path. By increasing the number of samples that are being cast through the data for
each ray, we are able to improve the overall quality of the image. Having too few sample
points along a ray gives rise to sampling artifacts such as rings or voids and decreases the
overall ”smoothness”. However, sampling more points takes longer to render. We observe a
1:1 correlation between changes in image rendering time and the number of samples per ray.
</li> 
</ol>

<p>To get a better grasp of the volume rendering process, we will be visualizing a 3D model of
density VTK file through both the VisIt GUI and then through the VisIt CLI. This file containing
this 3D data can be found at <a href="https://github.com/tsokaros/Illinois-NR-VisIt-Guide/blob/main/sec_4/sample_density.vtk"><code>VisIt-Guide/sec 4/sample density.vtk</code></a></p>
<ol>
   <li>
      In the GUI, begin by opening up the sample density.vtk file as a database. This can be
done by clicking Open and navigating to sample density.vtk in the file explorer that opens
up. From here, add a volume plot by clicking Add → Volume → density (Fig. 15) and
click Draw in order to create the plot.

<li>
Now we need to draw the sample density and choose the camera/viewing angle in a satisfactory
way. Next, open up the volume rendering settings in PlotAtts → Volume . . . , which will
open a window as in Fig. 16.
In order to activate ray casting, we will need to change the Rendering Method field from
Default Rendering to Ray Casting: compositing. Additionally, we will want to increase
the Samples per ray from 500 to 10000. Since the Ray Casting rendering method is
computationally expensive, make sure to finalize any adjustments to the viewing angle or the
model framing before activating the Ray Casting rendering process. The resulting visualization
should look similar to Fig. 17.

<li>
Within the transfer function, there are two distinct characteristics that we can experiment with:
color and opacity. Starting off with color, the smoothing attribute controls how VisIt will
interpolate between the specified color points to create a colorbar that is used to represent the
density values plotted within the model. There are three distinct options on how VisIt chooses
to interpolate the color points: Linear, Cubic Spline, and None. With Linear interpolation,
VisIt will create a simple gradient between each color point and numerically fill in each value.
With Cubic Spline, VisIt will create a piece-wise cubic polynomial in order to calculate the
color point values, which can create a different type of gradient across the colorbar. With None, 
VisIT will not interpolate the values in between the specified color points, which creates
a colorbar with discrete sections of color.

<h3 id="isosurface-rendering">Isosurface Rendering</h3>
<p>Like volume rendering, isosurface rendering is a way of visualizing 3D (as well as 2D) scalar fields.
The main advantage of isosurface rendering is that it is much less (about 10 times less, depending
on the number of isosurfaces) computationally expensive than volume rendering. With this increase
in computing speed, isosurface rendering loses detail and realism compared to volume rendering. As
the name suggests, isosurface rendering plots the data using isosurfaces: surfaces in which every
point has the same data value.</p>
<p>Isosurface rendering in VisIt uses the Pseudocolor plot with the Isosurface slicing operator
applied. The Pseudocolor plot is a general-purpose plot that different operators can be applied to.
The pseudocolor settings include the color table, and determine the color of specific isosurfaces. The
Isosurface operator extracts the data and linearly interpolates values between the data minimum
and maximum, with each interpolated value being referred to as a level. By default, VisIt constructs
10 levels across the data, however the specifications of these levels can be modified by the user by
either percentages between the minimum and maximum of the data such as 5 %, 15 %, or 20%, or
through explicitly specifying the level values themselves such using a comma-separated list of values
(e.g. (−2.6, −2.43, −2.32, . . .)).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="alt text" src="../img/figures/3.png" /></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p>Figure 21: Isosurface rendering of a massive accretion disk around a black hole</p>
</div>

<p>In Fig. 21, we use isosurface rendering to plot the fluid density of a massive accretion disk around
a black hole (here the Slice operator is used to view the interior of the disk). Since we are working
with an Isosurface operator applied to a Pseudocolor plot, we will need to experiment with
their respective settings when creating a visualization using isosurface rendering. We find that the
following parameters are the most important to consider when developing isosurface visualizations.</p>
<ol>
   <li><u><code>contourMethod</code>: Specifies the values of the isosurfaces</u>
VisIt offers three methods to select the specific isosurfaces that are plotted: Level, Percent,
and Value. If we choose Level, then VisIt will drawn N evenly spaced isosurfaces between a
specified minimum and maximum value (see min/max below) where N is a positive integer
specified by the contourNLevels field. If we have min=1, max=10, and contourNLevels=10,
then 10 isosurfaces will be placed at the values 1, 2, 3, . . . , 10. The Percent method works sim-
ilarly, but instead of drawing evenly spaced isosurfaces between min and max, it draws surfaces
using an array of percentages (i.e. numbers between 0 and 1) specified in the contourPercent
field. If we have min=0, max=10, and contourPercent=(0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.9), then 5
isosurfaces will be placed at the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 9. Lastly, if we choose the Value method, then
we can specify the exact values at which isosurfaces using an array of real numbers specified by
the contourValue field. This method doesn’t require min and max to be specified. If we have
contourValue=(0.0, 1.23, 3.14, 7.0, 7.01, 9.87), then 6 isosurfaces will be placed at
the values 0, 1.23, 3.14, 7, 7.01, 9.87. Since Value gives us the most control over the isosurfaces,
we commonly use this method. Having a larger number of isosurfaces spread across the desired
range increases the detail of the visualization. However, when the number of isosurfaces is
increased, the opacity of the isosurfaces should be decreased accordingly so that the interior
isosurfaces are still visible. 
</li> 
   <li><u><code>min/max</code>: Adjusts the range of data plotted</u>
If we wish to use a specific range of data, then we must set minFlag and maxFlag to 1 (true) in both the pseudocolor and isosurface settings (unless we are using contourMethod=Value in the isosurface settings, in which case it doesn’t matter). Then we can specify the minimum and maximum values for the color table (isosurfaces) by changing the min and max fields in the pseudocolor (isosurface) settings. If we leave min/maxFlag off, then the minimum/maximum values will be the absolute minimum/maximum values of the entire dataset.
</li>
   <li><u><code>colorTableName</code>: Sets the color table used by the plot</u>
The name of the color table used is set in the pseudocolor settings. The specifics about
creating and exporting a color table are discussed in Sec. 4.4.
</li> 
    <li><u><code>opacityType</code>: Sets the opacity of the isosurfaces</u>
In the pseudocolor settings, we set the opacityType field to either Constant or ColorTable.
If we set it to Constant, then we can set the opacity of all isosurfaces to an opacity specified by
the opacity field (which is a number between 0 and 1). If we set it to ColorTable, then the
opacity of each shell will be set according to the color table specified by the colorTableName
field. The opacity of the isosurfaces is an important parameter. If the opacity is too high,
then the outermost shells will conceal the inner shells and detail will be lost. If the opacity is
too low, then the object we are visualizing will be almost transparent. Using the opacity from
the color table gives us finer control over the opacities of each shell, which allows us to strike
the right balance.

</li> 
</ol>

<p>To better understand the isosurface rendering, we will be visualizing the same sample file we visualized
using volume rendering in the previous section: <a href="https://github.com/tsokaros/Illinois-NR-VisIt-Guide/blob/main/sec_4/sample_density.vtk"><code>VisIt-Guide/sec 4/sample density.vtk</code></a>.
We will create a visualization in the GUI and provide a CLI script that replicates the visualization.</p>
<ol>
<li>
In the VisIt GUI, begin by opening up the sample density.vtk as a database, which can
be done within the toolbar’s File → Open file, writing the path of the file within the
database window, and loading the aforementioned file. From here, we will want to add
Pseudocolor→density and the Operators→Slicing→Isosurface as seen in Fig. 22. Then
we can click on Draw in order to create a rendering of the data

<li>
At this point there are quite a few different settings we can adjust in order to improve on the
quality of the model, such as the pseudocolor settings of the model which is largely controlled
by the model’s color table. Colortables are critical to the structure of the visualization, as
the color table is essential in highlighting different attributes of the plot. In order to better
understand the structure of color tables so we can design and implement our own custom
color tables within our models, we break down the example color table as seem in Code
Listing 1. Within Visit, color tables are broken up into a series of discretely defined list
26 of colors within XML file under a .ct file extension. Within the XML file, the are listed
within a ColorControlPointList in which each distinct objects within the list define a
color value at a specific position between the colorbar. Looking at 1, we can see that there
are two fields of interest within each ColorControlPoint: the position field parameter
and the colors field parameter. An example of a fully detailed colorbar can be found at
VisIt-Guide/sec_4/bhbhdisk.ct

The colors field parameter defines the color and opacity value at that specific point within
the colorbar in a Red-Green-Blue-Alpha (RGBA) color value. The RGBA color value defines
a specific color through a mixture of Red, Green, and Blue pixel color values, which are all
defined as an integer between 0 to 256. The Alpha aspect of the RGBA color value can be
thought of as the associated opacity value for that specific color, which is also an integer
between 0 to 256.

The position field parameter is a float value defined between 0.00 to 1.00 that is associated
with the position of the corresponding RGBA color value within the colorbar. For example,
if this position field parameter float value is defined to be 0.5, then the RGBA color value
defined within the ColorControlPoint would be associated to the middle of the colorbar.
Essentially, VisIt will take these set of discrete color points defined across the colorbar and
will interpolate the color points in order to generate a fully continuous colorbar used to map
the different density values within the visualization. There are three distinct methods of
interpolation that VisIt can use to generate the colorbar from this pre-defined color point list:
CubicSpline, Linear, and None. With Linear interpolation, VisIt will create a simple gradient
between each color point and numerically fill in each value. With Cubic Spline, VisIt will
create a piece-wise cubic polynomial in order to calculate the color point values, which can
create a different type of gradient across the colorbar. With None, VisIT will not interpolate
the values in between the specified color points, which creates a colorbar with discrete sections
of color.


<li>
Now that we have a better understanding of exactly how the color table is set up, we
can move onto implementing it and utilizing its properties within our visualization. We
can begin by opening up the pseudocolor settings window as seen in 23 by navigating to
PlotAtts→Pseudocolor. . . on the GUI toolbar. In the Color section of this window, we
can adjust the color table and the opacity used by the plot. If we change the Opacity setting
in this section from Full opacity to From color table as well as the Color Table setting
to our custom colorbar, we can directly adjust colorbar and the different opacity levels used
in the plot through the settings delineated within the color table XML file, which gives us
finer control over the visualization. Now all of the color settings are imported from the color
table. To create a new color table for experimentation, we can open the color table window
by navigating to Controls→Color table... in the GUI toolbar. We describe how to create
and export a color table in Sec. 4.4. After the color table is created and exported, we will be
27 able to find the color table in the color table dropdown menu of the pseudocolor plot options
window. To experiment with color table settings, we can either modify and re-export the color
table in the color table settings window (Controls→Color table...) or directly modify the
.ct file found in ∼/.visit/ (which is where color tables export to).


<li>
Additionally, the clarity and resolution of the visualization can also be adjusted by experi-
menting with the isosurface rendering settings. Found at OpAtts→Slicing→Isosurface. . . ,
we can experiment with the isosurface operator characteristics. As mentioned previously, we
can adjust the number of isosurfaces and the values each isosurface corresponds to.

<h3 id="vector-fields">Vector Fields</h3>
<p>In this section, we will be making vector plots similar to section 4. The file containing the vector
field data we will be plotting is VisIt-Guide/sec 4/sample vector field.vtk, which is included
with this manual. This file contains data for the simple vector field F (x, y, z) = xˆx + y ˆy + z ˆz. We will give instructions on how to create a plot in the VisIt GUI, and then provide a script to make
the same plot using the VisIt CLI. In the GUI, first open sample vector field.vtk as a database.Then create a Vector plot, choosing vec field as the variable name. If we try clicking Draw,
then the plot will look empty. We will need to adjust some settings before the plot is useful. To do
this, open the PlotAtts dropdown menu and select Vector (Fig. 25).
On the window that opens up, navigate to the Glyphs tab on the top. The reason why no
vectors are showing up is because they are being autoscaled and scaled by magnitude. Since the
vector magnitude varies a lot across the grid (very large near the origin and very small away from
the origin), these two options aren’t good choices for a plot of this data, so uncheck those two boxes.
Now, all the vectors will be the same size. In addition to this, let’s increase the size of the vectors
by setting the scale to 2. Now, your window should look like Fig. 26.
To retain information about the magnitude of the vectors, we can apply a colorbar to the vectors.
To do this, navigate to the Data tab in the vector plot attributes window. Then in the colorbar
dropdown menu, choose the hot colorbar. Finally, to increase the number of vectors in our plot,
navigate to the Vectors tab and set the vector amount to 1000. These two tabs should look like
Fig. 27.
Finally, click Draw. Your plot should look like Fig. 28 (after rotating the plot with your cursor).
You are encouraged to explore some of the settings to see how they affect the plot. The CLI script that recreates the plot is in Code Lst. 4.2.3 and can also be found at
<a href="https://github.com/tsokaros/Illinois-NR-VisIt-Guide/blob/main/sec_4/run_vector.py"><code>VisIt-Guide/sec 4/run vector.py.</code></a>. We can run it as follows:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Code Listing 4.2.3:<code>run vector.py</code></p>
<p>Now that we know how to create vector plots, we will go over some important Vector plot
settings.</p>
<ol>
   <li><u><code>scale, scaleByMagnitude, autoScale, headSize</code>: Vector size</u>
These settings affect the size of the vectors in the vector plot. The parameter scaleByMagnitude
scales the size of the vector drawn by VisIt depending on the magnitude of the vector field at
that location. If the range of magnitudes of the vectors that we want to plot isn’t too large,
then we use this option to convey the magnitude of the vector field. However, if the range
of magnitudes is large, then it is hard to create a balanced plot: either the vectors with the
smallest magnitudes won’t be visible or the vectors with the largest magnitude will be too
large. In the case that the range of magnitudes is too large, then it is a good idea to encode
the magnitude of the vectors in their color rather than in their size. Then scaleByMagnitude
is turned off, all of the vectors will be the same size. The autoScale option automatically normalizes the size of the vectors. We usually turn this option off in favor of manually setting
a normalization by changing the scale option. It is important to note that the autoScale
and scale options scale the size of all the vectors regardless of whether scaleByMagnitude
is turned on or off. The headSize changes the size of the head of the vector relative to its
length. The thickness of the stem can changed using the stemWidth option 
</li> 
   <li><u><code>colorByMag, colorTableName, vectorColor</code>: Vector color</u>

If the option colorByMag is turned off, then all the vectors will be the same color. This color
is specified by changing vectorColor to the desired RGBA tuple. For example, for opaque
green vectors, we set vectorColor = (0, 255, 0, 255). If the option colorByMag is turned
on, then the color of the vectors will be determined by their magnitudes and the color table
specified by the colorTableName option. By default, the color table will run over the entire
range of magnitudes present in the data. If we want to restrict this range, we can turn on
the options minFlag and maxFlag and specify the minimum and maximum magnitudes by
changing min and max.
</li>
   <li><u><code>glyphLocation, nVectors, useStride</code>: Vector placement</u>
The choices for glyphLocation are AdaptsToMeshResolution and UniformInSpace. VisIt
uses AdaptsToMeshResolution as a default. In this case, areas with a finer grid (for example
when using adaptive mesh refinement) will have a denser distribution of vectors while areas
with a coarser grid will have a coarser distribution of vectors. Sometimes, this can lead to
awkward-looking plots where VisIt places most of the vectors in the region where the grid
is the finest. If we find AdaptsToMeshResolution causes the vectors to be too unevenly
distributed across the plot, then we set glyphLocation to UniformInSpace to place vectors
uniformly regardless of the grid. If useStride is set to false (which is the default), then
VisIt will attempt to place a fixed number of vectors specified by the nVectors field (note
that this is the number of vectors VisIt places before any selection operators are applied).
In the case that there are too many vectors or that the vectors are placed too close to each
other, we can set useStride to true. Doing this allows us to set the spacing between adjacent
vectors by changing the stride field. It is also helpful to note that by default, the vectors
VisIt draws represent the vector field at the tail of the vector. To change this, we can change
vectorOrigin option from Tail to Head or Middle. By default, VisIt will place vectors across
the entire grid which doesn’t give us precise control over the visualization. In a later section
(Sec. 5.4) we will describe how to use expressions and selection operators to restrict the vector
plot to specific locations.
</li> 

</ol>

<h3 id="streamline-integration">Streamline Integration</h3>
<p>Streamline integration is another way to visualize vector fields in VisIt. In many cases, it can be
more intuitive than vector plots. Since VisIt allows us to specify the seed points for streamlines, we
can emphasize the parts of the vector field that we want to focus on. Given a stationary smooth vector field F i and an initial condition xi(λ = 0), there exists a unique streamline x(λ) that satisfies
dxi
dλ = F i. The streamline traces a particle’s movement through the vector field. For example, in
an electric field Ei, a streamline seeded by a point x0 traces the movement of a positive charge
through Ei that starts at x0. In practice, numerical integrators look at the vector field around some
starting point x(t) and predict the position of the particle that moves along this vector field after
some small time dt. Then the process is repeated for the new starting point x(t + dt).
In this section, we will be visualizing the same vector field we used in section 4.2.3 but this time
using streamlines. In the GUI, we open sample vector field.vtk as a database. Streamlines plot
is actually the integral curve operator applied to the pseudocolor plot. In the Add plots dropdown,
navigate to: Pseudocolor → operators → IntegralCurve → vec field (Fig. 29).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="alt text" src="../img/sec_5_streamline_files/5.2.4.0-add_streamline.png" /></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p>Figure 29: Adding a streamline plot</p>
</div>

<p>Next, we need to pick seed points to use. To do this, we open the OpAtts (operator attributes)
dropdown menu at the top of the window and select: Integral Curves → IntegralCurve. Since
our vector field is spherically symmetric, we will choose seed points that lie on the surface of a
sphere. In the Source tab of the integral curve operator attributes window that opens up, select
Sphere. Set Radius to ‘5’ (note that Origin is already set to ‘0 0 0’ by default). Next, we set
Samples in Latitude and Samples in Longitude to ‘10’ and set Samples in R to ‘1’. These
settings will pick points uniformly distributed (with respect to the θ and ϕ spherical coordinates)
on the surface of a radius 5 sphere. Additionally, in the Integration tab, change Integration
Direction to Both so that the seed points integrate parallel and anti-parallel to the vector field.
Finally, in the Appearance tab, change Color by to Vector magnitude. Note that the color
table that is used is set by the pseudocolor settings (remember that IntegralCurve is an operator
applied to a Pseudocolor plot). The different settings we applied are shown in Fig. 30
Click Apply and then click Draw. Our plot should look like Fig. 31 (as we can see, the field
lines are radial as in a point charge.).
When recreating this image in the CLI, we will use a different method to choose our points.
Instead of using VisIt’s built-in seed generator to create a circle of seed points, we can use a Python
tuple. For example, if we want to use n seed points {(xi, yi, zi}n
i=1, then we can set the pointList
attribute equal to</p>
<div class="link">
(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, . . . , xn, yn, zn).

<p>This way, we can write our own scripts to generate seed points. In the following example, we use
NumPy. Another option is to read from a previously created text file. The CLI script that recreates
the plot is in Code Lst. 4.2.4 and can also be found at <a href="https://github.com/tsokaros/Illinois-NR-VisIt-Guide/blob/main/sec_4/sample_density.vtk"><code>VisIt-Guide/sec 4/sample density.vtk</code></a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Code Listing 4.2.4:<code>run streamline.py</code></p>
<p>Now that we know how to create streamline plots from a set of seed points, we will go over some
important integration settings. For our visualizations, we primarily tune the following integration
parameters.</p>
<ol>
   <li><u><code>PseudocolorAttributes()</code>: Streamline color</u>
In the CLI, changing the color of the streamlines is done by changing the PseudocolorAttributes()
corresponding to the plot (it seems that in the CLI, the streamlines are automatically colored
by magnitude which cannot be changed). To have constant color streamlines, a constant
color table must be created (see Sec. 4.4 for how to create a custom color table). This can
be applied to the streamlines plot by setting colorTableName to the new color table. As
usual with settings pertaining to color, we can set the bounds of the color table by turning on
minFlag, maxFlag and changing min, max. 
</li> 
   <li><u><code>maxStepLength</code>: Maximum step length taken at each integration step</u>

In practice, decreasing the maximum step length increases the smoothness of the streamline.
Integrators commonly increase the step length when the magnitude of the vector field is
greater, which can lead to jagged streamlines in areas where the field is strong. If you find
that your streamlines are jagged, decrease maxStepLength until your streamlines are smooth.
However, if your step length is too small, then your streamlines can get caught up in numerical
errors. It is important to note that decreasing the step length will decrease the overall length
of your streamline, which can be counteracted by increasing maxSteps.
</li>
   <li><u><code>maxSteps</code>: Number of integration steps taken</u>
For a fixed maxStepLength, increasing the number of integration steps typically increases the
length of the streamline. Since integrating more steps increases computational complexity, we
recommend starting with a smaller number of steps (≈ 1000) and increasing the number of
steps until you are satisfied with your image. A helpful way to visualize your seed points is by
setting the number of steps to 1-10. If you increase maxSteps but you don’t see any change in
the length of your streamlines, try using a different integrationType and maxStepLength.
</li> 
    <li><u><code>integrationDirection</code>: Integrate parallel or anti-parallel with the vector field</u>
You can integrate your seed points along the vector field using the Forward option (think the
movement of a positive charge in an electric field) and you can integrate your seed points
against the vector field using the Backward option (think the movement of a negative charge
in an electric field). To integrate in both directions, use the Both option.
</li>

<li><u><code>integrationType</code>: Integration algorithm used</u>
Integration methods affect the stability of the streamline. Lower-order integrators such as
Euler (first-order) or Leapfrog (second-order) are less accurate at following the exact solution
than Runge-Kutta (fourth-order) methods. However, streamline integration in 3D is very
finicky, and we sometimes have used Euler/Leapfrog to get better images.
<ul>
<li><u><code>DormandPrince</code>: Runge-Kutta-Dormand-Prince</u>
This is VisIt’s most advanced integrator, which allows the user to pick tolerances that
match the simulation data. It also uses an adaptive step length which you can limit by changing maxStepLength. We recommend defaulting to this integrator and experimenting
with the settings before trying other options.
</li>
<li><u><code>RK4</code>: Runge-Kutta 4</u>
This is a standard RK4 fourth-order integrator that uses a fixed step length that the user
can change by changing maxStepLength (this setting limits the maximum step length
for adaptive step integrators and sets the step length for fixed step integrators).
</li>
<li><u><code>Euler/Leapfrog</code>:</u>
Euler implements the standard first-order Euler method integrator and Leapfrog is a
second-order integrator. These are also fixed step length integrators. Since lower-order
integrators are more prone to error, we don’t recommend using these unless you’ve
exhausted the other options.
</ol>

<h2 id="expressions">Expressions</h2>
<p>There are often mathematical relationships derived from the different variables that exist in our
simulation data we will want to visualize. To address this need within scientific visualizations, VisIt
allows us to create mathematical expressions from database variables.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="alt text" src="../img/section5_expressionscorrelations/expressionsandcorrelationsfigure1.png" /></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p>Figure 32: Expression window within VisIt</p>
</div>

<p>In the GUI, expressions can be created and edited in the expressions window at Controls→Expressions.
On the left-hand side, there is an expression list that contains a list of different expressions that
have either been automatically created by VisIt or manually created by the user (Fig. 32). On the
right-hand side, we see the definitions for the mathematical expression that we have selected from
the expression list, which can be broken down into the Standard editor or the Python expression
editor. In order to create a new expression, there is a New button at the bottom left corner of
the editor. From here, the expression can be defined using the Python expression editor window or the standard editor window. There are multiple different options based on what type of variable is
being edited, found in the Type drop-down menu, which changes the use of the application of the
mathematical expression as expected.
We commonly use expressions in VisIt to normalize and transform the simulation data when
creating the visualization. For instance, in our visualizations of the fluid rest-mass density, we plot
the density in the units of initial maximum density as log(ρ0/ρmax
0 (0)) instead of just ρ0 so that we
can have more clarity. As an example, we will create this expression using the sample density.vtk
density file we visualized in Sec. 4.2.1 and Sec. 4.2.2. In VisIt, begin by navigating to Controls
→ Expressions and create a new expression within the expression window. Within this situ-
ation, we would like to transform the density variable, and after a simple examination of the
sample density.vtk file, we can find that the max variable is 1200.0. Using this information, we
can write the expression as seen within Fig. 33. After doing so, we use this variable by clicking the Apply button</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="alt text" src="../img/section5_expressionscorrelations/expressionsandcorrelationsfigure3.png" /></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p>Figure 33: Set up for log ρ expression</p>
</div>

<p>From here, we can create an isosurface rendering of the density, which can be done following the
steps listed in Sec. 4.2.2. The final image should look similar to Fig. 34.
Another way to use expressions is to create a vector field from three scalar fields. If the data for
the x, y, and z components of a vector field are contained in three separate scalar databases, then
they must be combined into a vector field expression before we create Vector or IntegralCurve
plots with the vector field data. For HDF5 data, the individual scalar databases must be cast onto
the same mesh before they are combined into a vector expression.
We will use HDF5 databases Bx.file * database, By.file * database, Bz.file * database
that contain magnetic field data that is output by the Illinois GRMHD code as an example. After
opening up these databases as the same type (in this case it would be CarpetHDF5), we must create
new scalar expressions of these databases after they have been cast onto the Carpet AMR-grid.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="alt text" src="../img/section5_expressionscorrelations/expressionsandcorrelationfigure4.png" /></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p>Figure 34: Isosurface rendering of log(ρ) - sample density</p>
</div>

<p>This is done with conn cmfe() method. For the Bx.file * database which has the HDF5 prefix
MHD EVOVLE, we would do:</p>
<div class="link">
<code>conn_cmfe(</path/to/data/Bx.file_* database[0]id:MHD_EVOLVE--Bx>, <Carpet AMR-grid>)</code>
</div>

<p>Using this expression, we create new expressions Bx, By, Bz for the three components of the magnetic
field that all share the same grid. To do this on the GUI for Bx, we create a new Scalar mesh
variable in the expressions window. We name it Bx and input the entire conn cmfe() command
shown above into the definition. We repeat the process for By and Bz. Then to create a vector
field, we create a new Vector mesh variable. We name it Bvec and input {Bx, By, Bz} into the
definition. The expressions for Bx and Bvec are shown in Fig.</p>

<h2 id="exporting-attributes">Exporting Attributes</h2>
<p>A typical workflow when using VisIt is to experiment with plot/operator settings using the more
intuitive GUI, and then implementing these settings in the CLI so they can be applied to a whole
suite of visualizations. Thankfully, if you need to change a lot of settings, you don’t need to write a
separate line of code for each setting like in the run vector.py example (Code Lst. 4.2.3). Instead,
VisIt allows your to export plot/operator settings in the GUI as .xml files which can then be loaded
in the CLI.
For example, if you are making a visualization that includes a volume plot, you will probably
want to finely tune things like the color table and opacity values until you are satisfied with an
image. If you don’t want to use any of the default VisIt color tables, then the first step would be
to create your own color table. First we launch the VisIt GUI, then we open up the color table
settings by opening the Controls dropdown menu in the toolbar and clicking Color table (Fig.
36). In the window that opens up, we can change the settings to our liking. When creating a new
color table, the first step is to choose the number of colors we want. Changing this field will change
the number of “color tabs” in the window. To change each individual color, we can click the “tab”
and change the RGB values respectively. We can also specify an alpha value, which determines the
transparency of the color (0 is transparent, 255 is opaque). Changing the opacities is especially
useful when using isosurface rendering. This is because there is an option to use the opacity from
the color table which gives us finer control over the opacity of the isosurfaces. We can also choose
how the colors are smoothed into each other.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="alt text" src="../img/sect_5_export/5.4.1-ct_atts.png" /></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p>Figure 36: Creating color tables</p>
</div>

<p>When we are done, we need to export the color table so it can be used in other parts of VisIt.
First, we give the color table a name in the Name field (in the example below, we name our
custom black and yellow color table my colortable). Then we click New and then Export to
save this color table in ∼/.visit/ (e.g. our color table saves as ∼/.visit/my colortable.ct).
Now, we are able to access this color table from the CLI. For example in Code Lst. 4.2.3, we can
write v.colorTableName = 'my_colortable' instead of v.colorTableName = 'hot' to use our
custom color table for the vector plot. To be more precise with our custom color table, we can open
up the exported <em>.ct</em> file to change the exact locations and the specific RBGA values of each color.
If we want to use custom color tables on another machine, we need to copy all the <em>.ct</em> files from
the first machine to the ∼/.visit/ folder on the second machine.
The next step in specifying settings for our volume plot would be to experiment with and export
the volume settings as an .xml file. First, we load up whichever database we want to visualize using
a volume plot. Then we open up the volume settings in the GUI by navigating to Volume in the
PlotAtts dropdown menu in the GUI toolbar. We then configure our volume settings to our liking
(we can choose the custom color table that we just made). When we are satisfied with the plot,
we can click Save which opens a file explorer. We then enter where we want to save your volume
attributes .xml file before saving (Fig. 37)</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p>Figure 37: Exporting attributes to .xml files</p>
</div>

<p>Now that we have a volume attributes .xml file saved, instead of specifying the volume settings
one by one in the CLI like shown in Code Lst. 4.4.</p>
<pre><code class="language-vtk">1 v = VolumeAttributes()
2 v.attribute1 = x1
3 v.attribute2 = x2
4 ...
5 SetPlotOptions(v)
</code></pre>
<p style="text-align: center;">Code Listing 4.4:<code>Changing settings manually in CLI</code></p>
<p>we can simply import our settings from the .xml file like shown in Code Lst. 4.4</p>
<pre><code class="language-vtk">1 v = VolumeAttributes()
2 LoadAttribute('/path/to/my_volume.xml', v)
3 SetPlotOptions(v)
</code></pre>
<p style="text-align: center;">Code Listing 4.4:<code>Importing settings from a .xml file</code></p>
<p>We usually like to store the more commonly reused settings, or more complicated settings such
as color tables or the freeformOpacity volume setting in .ct and .xml files. For some settings
that we change very often, it is still useful to directly set them in the CLI. Commonly, we load a
saved .xml file, and then override specific settings with our own choices.</p>

<h2 id="finalizing-images">Finalizing Images</h2>
<p>After you’ve decided on the plots, operators, and settings, the last step is to decide how you want
to present your 3D visualization. The first step is to set the View3DAttributes, which basically
determine where you place and point the camera and how far it zooms in on the plot. You’ve
already seen these options in all of the CLI sample scripts we’ve shown previously. The three
most important parameters are focus, viewNormal, viewUp, and imageZoom. The focus is where
the camera points, which is commonly set to the main object being visualized. The viewNormal
specifies the location of the viewer/camera and the viewUp specifies which direction is ‘up’ in the
final image. See Fig. 38 for a better understanding.
The imageZoom simply controls how zoomed in the camera is on the focus. In your script, to set
the view of your plot, add lines like</p>
<pre><code class="language-vtk">1 c = View3DAttributes()
2 c.viewNormal = (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
3 c.viewUp = (0.0, 0.0, 1.0)
4 c.focus = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
5 c.imageZoom = 1
6 SetView3D(c)
</code></pre>
<p style="text-align: center;">Setting Options Manually in CLI</p>
<p>The next things to change when finalizing an image would be the annotations. The VisIt labels
and legends aren’t super customizable, so the numerical relativity visualizations we make don’t
make use of them. With the exception of the t/M label, we finalize our images by removing all VisIt
legends and labels, and adding our own with image editors like GIMP or Photoshop. However, we will still briefly go over some of the options you have.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="../img/sec_5_finalize/5.5.1-text_annotation.png" /></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p>Figure 39: Text Annotations</p>
</div>

<p>o open the annotation settings in the GUI, click Annotation in the Control dropdown menu.
The setting that you might want to change first is the background color, which can be found in
Colors tab of the window that opens up. Change this to something that will make your visualization
stand out. To add text to your image, in the Objects tab, click the Text button on the upper left,
and configure things like the position, content, and font (Fig. 39).
You can turn off things like the legends (e.g. colorbars), axes, and bounding boxes by unchecking
the boxes in the General and 3D tabs. Below in Code Lst. 4.5, we provide a code snippet that
applies these annotation settings we’ve discussed.</p>
<pre><code class="language-vtk">1 a = AnnotationAttributes()
2 a.backgroundMode = a.Solid
3 a.backgroundColor = (155, 155, 155, 255) #gray
4 a.legendInfoFlag = 0
5 a.userInfoFlag = 0
6 a.axes3D.visible = 0
7 a.axes3D.triadFlag = 0
8 a.axes3D.bboxFlag = 0
9 SetAnnotationAttributes(a)
10
11 txt = CreateAnnotationObject(&quot;Text2D&quot;)
12 txt.position = (0.75, 0.95) #(x,y) where x and y range from 0 to 1
13 txt.useForegroundForTextColor = 0
14 txt.textColor = (255, 255, 255, 255)
15 txt.fontBold = 1
16 txt.fontFamily = txt.Times
17 txt.text = &quot;t/M = {}&quot;.format(int(t/M))
</code></pre>
<p style="text-align: center;">Code Listing 4.5:<code>Applying annotation settings</code></p>
<p>The final step is to specify the SaveWindowAttributes, which deal with the format of the saved
image file. You can choose where the image is saved, and the aspect ratio of the image, among other
settings. An example is shown in Code Lst. 4.5.</p>
<pre><code class="language-vtk">1 s = SaveWindowAttributes()
2 s.format = s.PNG
3 s.outputToCurrentDirectory = 1 #so we can choose where to output
4 s.fileName = &quot;/path/to/output&quot;
5 s.width = 1920 #creates a 1920 X 1080 image
6 s.height = 1080
7 s.resConstraint = s.NoConstraint
8 SetSaveWindowAttributes(s)
