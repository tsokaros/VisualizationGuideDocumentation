                <h1 id="visualizing-gravitational-waves">Visualizing Gravitational Waves</h1>
<p>In this section we will discuss how to visualize gravitational waves using numerical relativity
simulation data. Gravitational wave movies can provide helpful intuition about the systems being
simulated. When they are examined in conjunction with movies of the sources that produce them,
broad insights related to gravitational wave emission can be deduced. These visualizations will use
the following simulation output database:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Psi4_rad.mon.#</b>: ASCII files containing the Newman-Penrose scalar decomposed into s = −2
spin-weighted spherical harmonics ψ<sub>4</sub><sup>lm</sup>. There are multiple files with # = 1,2,...,9 that
correspond to different extraction radii r<sub>areal</sub>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These files have columns</p>
<p>t ∥ Re(ψ<sub>4</sub><sup>22</sup>) ∥ Im(ψ<sub>4</sub><sup>22</sup>) ∥ Re(ψ<sub>4</sub><sup>21</sup>) ∥ Im(ψ<sub>4</sub><sup>21</sup>) ∥ · · · ∥ Im(ψ<sub>4</sub><sup>last mode</sup>) ∥ r<sub>areal</sub> ∥ ⟨g<sup>tt</sup>⟩ ∥ ⟨g<sup>tr</sup>⟩ ∥ ⟨g<sup>rr</sup>⟩</p>
<p>The last three columns are averages of metric components. The fourth from the last column is
the extraction radius rareal. This value is relatively constant across a single file and is far enough
from the origin (where the compact objects are located) so that we are in the radiation zone.
Multiple files #=1,2,...,9 that correspond to different rareal are output so that we can confirm that
the gravitational wave amplitude falls of like r <sup>−1</sup> and otherwise does not depend on the extraction
radius. The first column is the simulation time t. The rest of the columns are the real and imaginary components of ψ<sub>4</sub> decomposed into ψ<sub>4</sub><sup>lm</sup>, which are the s = −2 spin-weighted spherical harmonics
<sub>-2</sub>Y <sub>lm</sub> (θ, ϕ) [1].</p>
<p>$$
\psi_4(t, \theta, \phi) =
\sum_{l=2}^{\infty} \sum_{m=-l}^{l} \psi_4^{lm}(t) \; {}^{-2}Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi)
$$</p>
<p>For example: columns 2, 3 are modes (l, m) = (2, 2); columns 4, 5 are modes (l, m) = (2, 1); columns
6, 7 are modes (l, m) = (2, 0) (note that we count down from m = l to m = −l). Continuing this
pattern, and noting that there are five l = 2 modes, seven l = 3 modes, etc., we know that</p>
<ul>
    <li>Columns 2 through 11 are the l = 2 modes</li>
    <li>Columns 12 through 25 are the l = 3 modes</li>
    <li>Columns 26 through 43 are the l = 4 modes</li>
</ul>

<p>and so on. In the Illinois GRMHD code, for binary black hole simulations, we output the first thirty
modes. This means that there are 2 ∗ 30 + 5 = 65 columns in the Psi4 rad.mon.# file (real and
imaginary column for each mode plus the five additional columns). In this case, the last mode
output would be (l, m) = (5, −3).</p>
<p>This file gives one-dimensional data of the ψ4 scalar as a function of time t that is extracted at
a radius rareal from the origin. In order to turn this into 3D data of the gravitational wave strain
h(t, r, θ, ϕ) that we can visualize and turn into a movie, a considerable amount of post-processing
must be done. The ‘plus’ and ‘cross’ polarizations of the strain h are related to ψ<sub>4</sub> by</p>
<p>ψ<sub>4</sub> = h¨<sub>+</sub> − ih¨<sub>×</sub></p>
<p>Thus in order to get the strain, we must perform a double time integration on ψ<sub>4</sub><sup>lm</sup>(t). Following the
method described in [5], we perform this double-time integration by dividing by ω<sup>2</sup>in Fourier space.
For frequencies close to zero, the calculation of the singular integral becomes inaccurate, therefore a
cutoff frequency ω0 is introduced [5]. We set ω0 equal or less than the initial orbital angular velocity
of the system (for the most dominant (2, 2) mode). Implementation-wise, the Fourier transforms are
done with a standard Fast Fourier Transform with padding added to each end of the time-domain
signal. After this double-time integration, we will have the values C<sup>lm</sup> as a function of time:</p>
<p>$$
C_{lm}(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{t} dt' \int_{-\infty}^{t'} dt'' \, \psi_4^{lm}(t'')
$$</p>
<p>At this step, we have an array of the C<sup>lm</sup>(t) that is a function of time. We already have the angular
dependence from the spherical harmonics <sub>-2</sub>Y<sub>lm</sub> (θ, ϕ). In order to obtain the radial dependence, we
will have to consider how the amplitude of h falls as 1/r, as well as the time retardation t = t(r)
due to the time it takes the signal to reach the observer at the radiation zone (at position r<sub>areal</sub>).</p>
<p>To add the time retardation, we consider howC<sup>lm</sup>(r) should look like at a fixed time t = t0. We
define a retarded time:</p>
<p>$$
t_0(r) =
\begin{cases}
t_0 - r &amp; \text{if } t_0 \ge r \\
0 &amp; \text{if } t_0 &lt; r
\end{cases}
$$</p>
<p>Note that in units of c = 1, the speed of gravitational waves is one. Therefore at a radius r, we
want to use the data “from the past” at time t0(r) = t0 − r. If our fixed time, t0, is relatively early
in the simulation so that t0 &lt; r, then it would have been impossible for a wave to propagate from
the origin to that radius r. In that case we set t0(r) equal to the first simulation time t = 0. Since
there might be numerical errors that cause C<sup>lm</sup>(t = 0) to be nonzero everywhere, we manually set
C<sup>lm</sup>(t = 0) = 0. Then we can add this time retardation, along with the 1/r dependence to get
radial dependence at a fixed time t0 using</p>
<p>$$
C_{lm}(t_0, r) = \frac{1}{r} \, C_{lm}(t_0(r))
$$</p>
<p>Then we can get the 3D data of the gravitational wave strain at a fixed time t0 using</p>
<p>$$
\frac{1}{2} \left( h_+(t_0, r, \theta, \phi) - i h_\times(t_0, r, \theta, \phi) \right) =
\frac{1}{r} \sum_{l=2}^{\infty} \sum_{m=-l}^{l} C_{lm}(t_0(r)) \, {}^{-2}Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi)
$$</p>
<p>The individual polarization h+ (h×) can be obtained by taking the real (imaginary) part of
this expression. Using the method described above, we are able to create a 3D data file that
contains the gravitational scalar field h+ or h× for every time from our original Psi4 rad.mon.#
file. In the following sections, we will discuss some nuances about the implementation as well as
the specifics about how to generate data files that can be visualized in VisIt using two different
rendering techniques.</p>
<h2 id="post-processing-implementation">Post-Processing Implementation</h2>
<p>The first thing we must do is choose the grid parameters of the 3D data that we will generate. A
choice that we make in the Illinois Relativity Group is to visualize the strain only in the lower
half z &lt; 0 space. Since the orbital angular momentum in our binary simulations points in the
zˆ direction, plotting the strain in z &lt; 0, gives a cross-section on the xy-plane as viewed from
above (i.e. a bird’s eye view from a point on the positive z axis). We choose a grid where the
xy slices are squares of length 2L. Since we only want to plot z &lt; 0, we use a grid such that
(x, y, z) ∈ [−L, L] × [−L, L] × [0, L]. We want to pick L large enough such that we can observe
the outward propagation of the waves. For the images above, we used L = 75 (remembering that
c = 1). Additionally, we will need to choose the number of grid points in the x, y, z directions,
which we will denote by nx, ny, nz. We’ve found that having a grid spacing of 1 in code units is
enough to produce good visualizations. For now on, we will adopt the notation i, j, k when refering
to the x, y, z indices of our grid. Assuming L = 75 with (nx, ny) = (150, 150) and nz = 75, then
(i, j, k) = 0, 0, 0 would correspond to (x, y, z) = (−75, −75, −75) and (i, j, k) = (149, 149, 74) would
correspond to (x, y, z) = (75, 75, 0).</p>
<p>After we’ve chosen our grid, we create lookup tables that give us the values of <sub>-2</sub>Y<sub>lm</sub>(θ, ϕ) =
<sub>-2</sub>Y<sub>lm</sub>(x, y, z) and r = r(x, y, z) at each grid point since these values will be used at each time step
and can be rather expensive to compute (especially the <sub>-2</sub>Y<sub>lm</sub>). The lookup tables for <sub>-2</sub>Y<sub>lm</sub> will
be arrays of shape [n x,n y,n z,n modes] ([n x,n y,n z]) that we can access as Ylm[i,j,k,m]
(r[i,j,k]). Here n x, n y, n z are nx, ny, nz and n modes is the number of lm-modes that were
in the output Psi4 rad.mon.# files (i.e. n_modes is P N
l=1
P
l
m=−l
1 = N(N + 2) where the sum is
cutoff at l = N while theoretically it should extend to ∞).</p>
<p>Then we can start calculating h+ and h×. The <sup>lm</sup>(t) that we obtain by double time integrating
ψ<sub>4</sub><sup>lm</sup>(t) is a function of time and the lm-modes. It can be loaded into an array of the shape [n times,
n modes] that we can access as Clm[t,m]. Here n times is the number of iteration times (i.e. the
number of rows) in our output Psi4 rad.mon.# file. In order to apply Eq. 5 to this array, we need
to express Eq. 4 in terms of indices. To do this, we need the time step dt between times. Then we
can use</p>
<pre><code>rt = ((t - (r / dt)).astype(int)).clip(min=0)
</code></pre>
<p>to implement Eq. 5. This example is in Python, and r is the lookup table NumPy array for r and t
is the index for the time. This way, t and r/dt both have “index” dimensions. It is then cast as an
integer and all negative values are set to zero so that rt is an array of indices (that we can access
as rt[i,j,k]). Then NumPy allows us to simply do</p>
<pre><code>Clm_ijk = Clm[rt,:]
</code></pre>
<p>to implement Eq. 5 and create an array Clm ijk of shape [n x,n y,n z,n modes]. This is now
the same shape as the lookup table Ylm so now Eq. 6 can be implemented by summing over the
lm-modes and dividing by the r lookup table</p>
<pre><code>hplus_hcross = 2*(1/r)*np.einsum('ijkm-&gt;ijk', Clm_ijk*Ylm)
</code></pre>
<p>where we have used NumPy’s einsum method to sum over the modes. Then h+ and h× can be
obtained by taking the real and imaginary parts of the hplus hcross array of complex numbers.
Moving forward, we refer to either h+ or h× as simply h (or h).</p>
<p>At a fixed time t*dt (remember that t is an index), we have obtained an array h=h[i,j,k].
The last remaining step before we discuss visualization is how to store the data contained in this
array in a format that is usable by VisIt. We will use .vtk files to store this scalar data. The
first thing we have to do is setup the header of the .vtk file. We will use the option DATASET
STRUCTURED POINTS since we have a predefined grid with fixed spacing. The DIMENSIONS field is
n x, n y, n z (150, 150, 75 with the grid we’ve been using). The ORIGIN field is the minimum
value of the x, y, z coordinates which is −L for all three (with our choice of L it is -75 -75 -75).
The SPACING field is spacing between grid points in each direction. Since we are going from -75 to 75
with 150 points, the spacing is actually (2L+ 1)/nx (for our choice, the spacing in the x, y directions
is 151/150 ≈ 1.00666 and the spacing in the z direction is 76/75 ≈ 1.01333). Having this slight offset between our grid points and the integers helps us avoid a singularity at the origin (since we divide
by r). Finally the POINT DATA field is just the product nxnynz (here 150 × 150 × 75 = 1687500).
After inputting the grid settings in the header, we just have to add the data. According to the
.vtk documentation, the STRUCTURED POINTS option means that we must input our data with the
x coordinate increasing the fastest, then the y, and then the z. In NumPy, one way to convert an
array that is indexed like h[i,j,k] to a 1D array that follows this criteria is by doing</p>
<pre><code>h_kji_flat = (np.einsum('ijk-&gt;kji', h)).flatten()
</code></pre>
<p>Below we show an example of such a .vtk file.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><code>VTK File Containing 3D Gravitational Wave Data</code></p>
<p>For 2D data, the process is very similar. We can pick an arbitrary two-dimensional slice by
choosing two orthogonal unit vectors u, ˆ vˆ (usually these are just x, ˆ yˆ) and define our grid using these
coordinates. We choose a square grid u, v ∈ (−L, L). Since we don’t want to see the edge of our grid
in the contour plot, we choose a slightly larger value L = 100. We’ve again found that a grid spacing
of 1 is good enough so in the visualizations we show later, we have (nu, nv) = (200, 200). After
choosing the grid, the process to get arrays of the strains h+ and h× follows the same procedure as
the 3D data (just with one fewer index in our arrays). We typically multiply all the values of the strain h by a large constant (we use a constant C = 2000) to make the plot more visible.</p>
<p>To store the data, we again use a .vtk file, which uses the same format with one fewer
dimension. The differences can be seen in the example below of a .vtk file containing two-dimensional
gravitational wave data.</p>

<p>A .vtk file will need to be generated at even intervals across the entire dataset in order to create
a movie. The files should be named like h 00000.vtk, h 00001.vtk, and so on so that they can be
loaded in VisIt as the database h *.vtk. Now that we’ve generated 3D and 2D gravitational wave
data, it is time to visualize them.</p>
<h2 id="three-dimensional-volume-plot">Three Dimensional Volume Plot</h2>
<p>In this section, we will discuss how to visualize gravitational waves using a volume plot of the scalar
field h+ or h× in three dimensions. The main difference between volume rendering of density and
volume rendering of gravitational waves is our choice of opacity and colorbar. The range of data is
symmetric about zero. Since we are making a volume plot, we should strategically choose settings
to bring out the wavelike nature of the data we are working with.</p>
<p>Since the range of the data is symmetric about zero, we want to choose a colorbar that has this
symmetry as well. Additionally, we want the colorbar to also tell us something about the magnitude
of the wave. The decision that we’ve made is to choose darker colors for higher magnitudes and
lighter colors for lower magnitudes. For the actual colors, we went with yellow (cyan) for positive (negative) values with lower magnitudes, and green (blue) for the positive (negative) values with
higher magnitudes. The final colorbar can be seen in Fig. 67.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="../img/GWs/3D_GW_1.1.png" />
<img alt="alt text" src="../img/GWs/3D_GW_1.2.png" /></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p>Figure 67: 3D volume rendering of gravitational waves.</p>
</div>

<p>For the opacity, we also want to make it symmetric about zero. Next, we want to make sufficiently
small magnitudes transparent. If we didn’t, then the entire visualization will be dominated by values
that are zero or near zero. Additionally, we’d like the larger magnitudes to have higher opacity than
the lower magnitudes so they stand out in the final visualization. An optional trick that we use
to further bring out the wavelike nature of the data is to add small peaks in the lower magnitude
parts of the opacity array. Adding these peaks creates more “wavelike” parts of the volume plot
that propagate outwards when a movie is created. In Fig. 67, these peaks are reflected by the more
pronounced “stripes” of yellow and cyan on the outer edge of the visualization. The opacity array
with the above features as displayed in the VisIt GUI is shown below in Fig. 68. Here, we can see
how the region around zero (where cyan turns to yellow) has zero opacity. We can also see the
peaks in the lower magnitude parts of the colorbar (yellow and cyan) as well as higher opacities for
the higher magnitude parts of the colorbar (green and blue).</p>
<p>After choosing the volume settings and exporting them to .xml files as described in Sec. 4.4,
volume plots of the strain h can be made as we’ve done previously (e.g. Sec. 4.2.1).</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the 3D data we are working with is only present in the lower half of R^3, where z &lt; 0, so we can see a cross-section on the xy-plane. To visualize this entire cross-section, we
usually choose a top-down view (i.e. with a view normal of the form (0, 0, +z)). This top-down view
can be seen on the left-hand side of Fig. 69. Another option that brings out the three-dimensional
nature of our data is to pick a side view, which can be seen on the right-hand side.</p>
<p>After the volume settings and view are decided, all that is left to do in order to create a movie,
is to use these settings to produce stills for every time step. When we create the t/M label in these
images that show the time step, we remember that the original Psi4 rad.mon.# data file we used
was extracted at a radius rareal from the origin. That means that waves take a time t = r<sub>areal</sub> to propagate from the origin to the extraction radius. Since we want to compare our gravitational
wave visualizations directly with the movies of the compact object sources, we must subtract rareal
from the times. So we are actually using (t-r areal)/M to label our images. See the link below for
an example of a gravitational wave movie that was created using data from a binary black hole
simulation.</p>

<h2 id="two-dimensional-contour-plot">Two Dimensional Contour Plot</h2>
<p>In this section, we will discuss how to visualize gravitational waves using a contour plot. This type
of plot visualizes the strain h+ or h× on a two-dimensional slice of three-dimensional space. The strain is visualized as a surface h(u, v) where u, v are the two orthogonal coordinates that span the
two-dimensional slice. While this contour plot only visualizes a 2D slice of the data, it doesn’t rely
on changing the colorbar and opacity to only visualize certain magnitudes. It also is more intuitive
since visualizing gravitational waves on a surface can be imagined as “ripples on a pond”.</p>
<p>To create a contour plot, we will use a <b>Pseudocolor</b> and <b>Mesh</b> plot with the <b>Elevate</b> operator
applied. Optionally, we can add a <b>Resample</b> operator and a <b>Cylinder</b> operator. Their purposes
are outlined below.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Pseudocolor</b> plot with a constant colorbar to visualize the surface.</li>
    <li><b>Mesh</b> plot to visualize the grid. Adding the grid highlights how the 2D slice of space we are
        plotting curves in the presence of gravitational waves.</li>
    <li><b>Elevate</b> operator applied to both plots that uses the h(u, v) function. This creates a surface
        plot of h(u, v). It is important to note that VisIt can only create an elevated pseudocolor
        plot as a surface like z(x, y), where x, y, z are the coordinates of VisIt’s three-dimensional. In
        other words, VisIt will rotate the general 2D slice the generated data encodes to its xy-plane.</li>
    <li><b>Resample</b> operator to change the resolution of the grid we visualize with the <b>Mesh</b> plot.</li>
    <li><b>Cylinder</b> operator to only plot the surface at radii r greater than a specified radius r0, which
        is far enough from the source such that we are in the radiation zone.</li>
</ul>

<p>An example of a contour plot of gravitational waves on the xy-plane for a binary black hole can
be seen in Fig. 70. The constant color for the <b>Pseudoclor</b> plot here is a teal blue. We choose a
constant colorbar since the information about the strain h is already encoded in the elevation of the
surface. The grey lines on the surface are created by the <b>Mesh</b> plot and showcase the gridlines of
constant x or y values. The <b>Elevate</b> operator creates the surface plot of h(x, y), which creates the
curved surface. The <b>Cylinder</b> operator cuts out the region at the center of the “spiral” to only
visualize the surface in the radiation zone.</p>
<p>In Code Lst. 10.3 below, we provide VisIt CLI code that loads the h *.vtk database and adds
the plots and operators described above.</p>

<p>The specific settings we’ve applied to each plot/operator are justified below</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>PseudocolorAttributes()</b>: The <b>Pseudocolor</b> plot is added with the variable GW-FIELD, which corresponds to the data loaded in the h_*.vtk files. Here, constant_colortable is a place holder for a constant color table, which can be made by creating a fully opaque color table with only one color (see Sec. 4.4). The min and max values are turned on and set to ±100 to ensure that the entire range of data falls within the color table limits so that
    the plot is all one color. The line smoothingLevel = 1 chooses an interpolation algorithm.
    We’ve found that it must be set to 1 (which corresponds to VisIt’s ‘fast’ algorithm) for the <b>Pseudocolor</b> and <b>Mesh</b> plots to align when the <b>Elevate</b> operator is applied.</li>
    <li><b>MeshAttributes()</b>: Like the <b>Pseudocolor</b> plot, we set the smoothingLevel field to Fast.
        Setting foregroundFlag to False will use the default color of black instead of the foreground
        color for the mesh lines.</li>
    <li><b>ResampleAttributes()</b>: We set is3D to false since we are working with 2D data. Then we
        resample to have 200 grid points in the x and y directions. Increasing this number will increase
        the smoothness of the plot but decrease the visibility of the individual squares of the Mesh
        plot. Resample should only be used to downsample from the original resolution of the data.</li>
    <li><b>ElevateAttributes()</b>: We set the variable to GW-FIELD, which corresponds to the strain
        data loaded in the h *.vtk files. We set useXYLimits to never so that the elevation height
        isn’t scaled automatically.</li>
    <li><b>CylinderAttributes()</b>: We set point1, point2 to points on the positive and negative z-axis.
        These points are the ends of the cylinder. We set radius to a specified wave zone r r0to only
        show the plot in the radiation zone. We set inverse to true so that everything outside this
        cylinder is plotted (i.e. the near zone region r < r0 is not plotted).</li>
</ul>

<p>For the view, we use viewNormal = (0, 1.2, 1), focus = (15, 10, ), viewUp = (-0.2, -1.2,
1), and imageZoom = 3.2. It is important to note that since our data is on a two-dimensional
square grid, we can’t zoom out too much, or else the edges of the grid will be visible (Fig. 71). For
our grid with range x, y ∈ (−L, L) with L = 100, we found that a zoom of 3.2 works. If we’d like
to zoom out to show a larger portion of the waveform, then we’d have to generate the data using a
grid with a larger value of L. As we did for the gravitational wave movie using three-dimensional
volume rendering, we use a time label of (t-r_areal)/M to synchronize the gravitational wave movie
with the movie of the compact object sources. An example of this synchronization can be seen in
Fig. 72. Gravitational waves and the source visualization of an accretion disk surrounding a rapidly
rotating black hole are shown. At this snapshot, the misalignment between the angular momentum
of the black hole and the disk causes the disk to undergo a violent distortion that emits gravitational
waves. By synchronizing the time labels of the two movies, this violent behavior will be immediately
reflected in the gravitational wave movie. The entire movie can be found at the link below.</p>
